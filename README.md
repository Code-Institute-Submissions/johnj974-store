</a>UX</h2>
<p>This is an ecommerce website, it is designed for an owner to provide customers with products which they can buy once they have registered
any user can view the site but you must be logged in to access the products for sale, the products page leads to the cart where the customers 
can amend their orders. They can then process their payments through the checkout page and validate payment using Stripe </p>

</a>Features</h2>

<p>The home page has a landing image and a basic navigation bar and footer, there is a message for any new user to the site,
the navigation bar has all the links required to navigate around the site, any user that does not log in can only view the products,
they have the option of registering from the navigation bar</p>
<p>Once a customer logs in they have the option of puchasing any of the products from the products page, there is a search function
 located in the navbar to help customers look for items, when a customer adds items to the basket
  there is a counter on the cart which gives them a visual clue as to the amount of products that they have added, the customer
  clicks on the cart to access the cart page where they can amend each item in their shopping cart before moving onto the checkout page, 
  there is a list at the top of the page again confirming the products for purchase before the customer enters delivery and payment details </p>

</a>Features Left to Implement</h2>
<p>This site is far from finished, there are a lot of features on the site that could be done a lot better given more time and more experience.</p>
<p>I started a rare items page that would only appear if you were a registered or logged in customer, my idea was that it would be a reward
 for registering to the website, however when I tried to put the rare item into the cart it kept getting over ridden by the producks id key, I would 
 like to fix this when I have more time. I removed the connection to the app until I can figure out how to implement it correctly </p>
 <p>More detailed information about the products such as the number in stock and a way of recording items sold in total and maybe over a certain
 period of time. I would also include an individual counter on each product to show the amount of each item a person has in their cart.</p>
 <p>I did not get a chance to finish the profile page of the logged in user, I would like it to show customers address and purchasing history</p>

</a>Testing</h2>
<p>The site was tested on mobile devices manufactured by huawei,apple and samsung.it was tested on laptop devices and desktops
 of varying sizes and operating systems such as chrome,firefox, and edge, only slight styling changes were observed<br>
 The following tests were conducted on the site to check functionality. <br>
 <ul>
 <li>All navbar links on all the differant pages were checked and all of them are linked correctly.</li>
 <li> The footer links were checked and all of them work and open in a seperate window.</li>
 <li> All functional buttons are working on site</li>
 <li> All input fields were checked and all inputs are being recorded</li>
 <li> All pages when resized are responsive and are easy to navigate.</li>
 <li>All the forms were checked for required input fields</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>I used html validators and css validators to check for errors in the code, I corrected any errors</p>
<p>The forms for login and registering were tested to confirm it displays a message to the user asking to enter
 the required information and preventing the form submission in case a field was left empty.
The social media links were tested individually to make sure it does redirect the user to the relevant content and that they
opened in seperate tags</p>
<p>Manual testing was done on all the functionality of the site.
 The products were successfully loaded and stored in the database, same with the profile of the user.
  Products were added to the cart and moved to the checkout successfully and the Stripe payment function
   has been verified with a test card and all transactions show up on the Stripe dashboard.</p>
<p>Automated testing was done by Travis-CL, there were a lot of errors during the build but they all seemed to get 
ironed out as I went over the code</p>

</a>Deployment</h2>
<p>This site was deployed to Heroku using the command line interface<br>
   The steps taken to deploy the app were:<br>
   <ul>
   <li>1. I created a Heroku account</li>
   <li>2. Click on the new button to create the app name I used to run my project.</li>
   <li>3. Choose the region that the server will be based from.</li>
   <li>4. Log into Heroku from the CLI, I needed to provide confirmation using a url.</li>
   <li>5. I insured that the requirements.txt file was installed along with a procfile and that</li>
      all environmental variables were safely hidden in a git ignore file.
   <li>6. I added my files and then commited them to the github repository.</li>
   <li>7. From the Heroku home page that has my app that was created earlier I copied a
      line of code under the Create a new directory that has my application name
      and inserted it into the CLI to create a link between my code and Heroku.</li>
   <li>8. Once that snippet of code runs I typed: git push heroku master to push my</li>
      project to the Heroku server to be run.
   <li>9. Type heroku ps:scale web=1 to start the app, confirmation is when it is scaling dynos</li>
  <li>10. I went back to Heroku, go to settings, go to reveal config vars, input my IP and PORT</li>
      addresses and also add in any variables that are kept in the gitignore file.
  <li>11. When all configs are input I clicked on open app and my project was being hosted by Heroku.</li>
  <li>12. My initial deployment was implemented using the ClI, further deployments were initialised from the heroku dashboard.</li>
  <li>13. To deploy from heroku I added,commited and pushed any changes of code to github.</li>
  <li>14. I went to the deploy section in heroku which is already referanced to the app name.</li>
  <li>15. I chose connect to github in the deployment method of the deploy page.</li>
  <li>16. I input my github login details and the app i wished to connect with</li>
  <li>17. When i received notification of the connection i chose manual deploy of the app.</li>
  <li>18. The most up to date version of the app is then hosted on Heroku</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>To view the app after initial setup in Heroku</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Login to heroku</li>
    <li>Choose app name.</li>
    <li>Choose Deploy header in dashboard.</li>
    <li>Go to bottom of page and click on deploy branch</li>
    </ul>

<p>The project was built using the code institute django module as the main go to referance when I got stuck,the majority of the 
functionality comes from the django  module tutorial. I also used various youtube channels
such as Traversy media, Dennis Ivy, Corey Schafer and Freecodecamp for ideas along with all the various stack overflow threads which helped to me to
identify and fix a lot of the errors that I encountered</p>
